# Statistical Learning

This is a collection of my computational notes on statistical learning, machine learning, and data science. It is new and growing. The topics are oriented for experienced python programmers with a strong mathematical background who may not be familiar with the field of statistical learning.

The following points make this collection unique that you may want to consider before continuing:

1. **Plotly**: I believe Plotly is a superior data visualization library. I will not be using Matplotlib since it doesn't provide the customization I need and I'm much more productive using Plotly. On top of that, Plotly is JS based and interactive; you cannot beat that.
2. **Scipy**: Majority of machine learning tutorials out there are using sk-learn. Instead, here I will try using the stats module of Scipy since it is more fundamental, has better documentation, and is more customizable. Having said that, I will use sk-learn whenever it is superior to Scipy.
3. **Data Simulation**: Most importantly, whenever possible, I will simulate the data in the code since I believe data simulation is one of the main pillars of data science: data wrangling, data simulation, modeling, visualization.
